Description: This package is intended to be the first step in 
    developing an in-house opioid overdose surveillance system for research 
    and/or outreach based on Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data. 
    It is an improvement of work conducted from 2017-2019 for the Marin County
    Department of Health and Human Services that created a 
    near real-time surveillance and outreach system for multiple drugs of 
    public health concern from EMS data (Development of Text-Based Algorithm 
    for Opioid Overdose Identification in EMS Data. International Society 
    for Disease Surveillance Annual Meeting 2019. Oral Presentation. Patton, A). 
    Surveillance systems from overdoseR can created from custom models based on data 
    from your own jurisdiction and can also directly use pre-validated
    and tuned models from  Marin County Department of Health and Human Services. 
    In practice from 2017-2019 in a live surveillance system, these models and 
    their variations were over 99% specific and 95% sensitive for opioid overdoses 
    and opioid related events.
