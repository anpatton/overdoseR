Description: overdoseR is an all in one model development and model usage
    package that is based on work conducted in 2018 for Marin County Department
    of Health and Human Services that created a near real-time surveillance
    system for opiod overdoses based on EMS (911) data. This package can
    be used to create custom models based on data from your own jurisdiction
    and can use directly use pre-validated and tuned models from data
    via Marin County Department of Health and Human Services. 
    In practice, these models and their variations were over 99% specific and
    99% sensitive for opioid overdoses and opioid related events.
